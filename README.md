# adcirc-lib

At the moment, it is assumed that the adcirc-lib repository is located at the same directory level as all of the plugins. Until I get things on npm and can use some rollup plugins you'll have to build this way.

## Supported plugins

* [adcirc-events](https://github.com/atdyer/adcirc-events)
